All images provided from Hallowette needed to be broken into layers to be animated and brought into the gameplay environment.\n\nThere are various levels that increase in difficulty. Each unlocking a piece of art as a reward. Each level has it's own theme that comes back to haunt the user in the final level.\n\nThe final level was what started the whole concept of this game. A zoom quilt style world where the level starts with one image and continually zooms deeper and deeper into it while revealing elements and gameplay pieces.",
